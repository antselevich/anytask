===============

:command:`rbt list-repo-types` will print the list of supported repository
types. Each printed type can be used as a value to the
:option:`--repository-type` option of many rbt commands.

If a repository of a specific type is detected in the current directory,
that repository type will be marked by an asterisk (``*``).

===========================
RBTools 0.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date**: May 30, 2013


New Features
============

* Improved the readability of :command:`rbt status` output.

  Each review request output is now indented, causing the IDs and
  draft indicators to line up.

* Added a :option:`--repository-type` option to most commands.

  Any :command:`rbt` commands which work with the repository, including
  :command:`post-review`, now have a :option:`--repository-type` option. This
  option allows the user to specify a particular repository type to be used.

  This type can also be set for a repository by setting
  ``REPOSITORY_TYPE`` in :file:`.reviewboardrc`.

* Added a :option:`--list-repository-types` option to :command:`post-review`.

  This option will cause :command:`post-review` to print the valid repository
  types and then exit. This can be used to see valid values for the new
  :option:`--repository-type` option.

* Added a new :command:`rbt list-repo-types` command.

  The new :command:`rbt list-repo-types` command will print the valid
  repository types. These values can be used for the new
  :option:`--repository-type` option.

* Third-parties can now write new SCM support by creating Python packages
  leveraging Python entry points. SCMClient subclasses can be registered
  through the ``rbtools_scm_clients`` entry point.

  All our SCMClients are registered this way as well.


API Client Changes
==================

* Added an API Client method for retrieving resources from a path.

  The RBClient now has a ``get_path`` method, which will accept a path and
  retrieve the API resource at that path. For example, a path of
  ``/review-requests/123/`` would retrieve the resource at
  ``http://example.com/api/review-requests/123/``

* Add a ``get_or_create_draft`` method to the API.

  This new resource-specific method for Review Request Resources allows
  creating/retrieving a Review Request Draft resource. Previously,
  this was only accessible after first uploading a diff, which is no longer
  required.

* Restructured the API Client internally.

  Instead of wrapping everything and hiding resources inside of various
  Transport objects, Resource objects are now returned to the user. The
  Transport no longer serves as an all-wrapping, interface to and
  between everything, super object, but as a simple interface to the
  Review Board server.

  Resource method calls which return HttpRequests are now decorated,
  which serves as the new wrapping mechanism. The decorator captures
  calls to these methods, and passes the internal method, and arguments,
  off to the Transport to be executed. The new simpler Transport now
  only provides a few core methods; primarily it needs to be able to
  massage the provided arguments, call the method, and deal with the
  returned HttpRequest in a suitable manner. This should make writing
  a new synchronous Transport simple.

  Now that proper Resource objects are returned, API users can rely on
  checking class types using :py:func:`isinstance` to differentiate
  between item and list resources, etc.

  Additionally, dictionary or list fields returned from a resource use
  standard class types, regardless of the transport used.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed crash when copying old post-review cookies for use with
  :command:`rbt`.

  An edge case existed where copying old post-review cookies to be used with
  the :command:`rbt` command would cause a crash. Cookies will now be copied
  properly.

* :command:`rbt` commands will now properly generate diffs with moved files.

  The :command:`rbt` commands were not properly checking the capabilities of
  the Review Board server, and always assumed there was no support for moved
  file diffs. The capabilities of the server are now properly checked, and
  diffs with moved files will be generated when appropriate.

* Fixed references to non-existent variables in :command:`rbt patch`.

  The :command:`rbt patch` command would immediately crash, making it
  unusable.  The command now functions properly.

  Patch by Adam Collard.

* Fixed :command:`rbt post` for Perforce repositories.

  When using :command:`rbt post` with Perforce, posting an update to a review
  request using a change number would result in an error. We now properly
  update the review request instead of failing.

* Fixed :command:`rbt post` and :command:`rbt diff` for Subversion and
  Bazaar.

  A number of cases causing crashes when using :command:`rbt` with Subversion
  and Bazaar have been fixed.

* Fixed :command:`post-review` and :command:`rbt` when used for Perforce
  paths.

  Posting a code review using a path no longer results in a crash.

  Patch by Damian Johnson (:bug:`2881`).

* Fixed error handling when posting a review request.

  If an unhandled error code was returned from the server, the process
  would just quit without any useful indication of what went wrong. We
  now use the error message from the server.

  On top of this, :command:`rbt post` and :command:`post-review` now check
  against the proper error code for the Empty Diff error.


Packaging Changes
=================

* Conditionalize ez_setup.

  This makes life simpler for packagers, since most packaging tools
  will ensure that the appropriate packages are available on the
  system. Additionally, most packaging tools prefer not to rely on
  network access (since it can mean that identical rebuilds cannot be
  performed).
